# Android host (bring-up)

The host in `dm/host` and `dm/gfx` built for Android (arm64, API 30 = Android 11 and newer, Vulkan 1.1 and newer) with the NDK. Status: the game's code runs
natively, with sound (AAudio), saves and a Vulkan graphics backend (`src_vk/nvn_vk.c`), as an app (`app/`, `tools/make_apk.py`)
or an adb program. Checked with Hollow Knight 1.5.12620 on an ANBERNIC RG Slide (Unisoc T820, Mali-G57, Android 13): the app
plays it in handheld mode at about 59 fps (GPU 16 ms a frame in Dirtmouth), with controllers, the start-up menu and cheats.

## How it differs from the Apple host

- **Thread slots.** Rewritten game code reads its four thread slots (x18, tpidr_el0, tpidrro_el0, the gate) through
  `tpidr_el0` and bionic's `TLS_SLOT_APP` instead of Apple's pthread TSD. Rewrite the modules with
  `DM_PATCH_TP=android dm/tools/patch_nso.py ...` into a folder of their own: the loader refuses modules rewritten
  for the other platform (`TP_SLOT` in `<module>.fixups.tsv`).
- **Apple APIs.** `compat/` supplies the Mach, libdispatch, QoS, malloc-zone, CommonCrypto, clonefile and xattr calls
  the shared code makes (see `compat/README.md`).
- **Platform parts.** Audio output is an AAudio stream (`hle_audio.c`). H.264 is decoded by the NDK's MediaCodec
  (`hle_movie_avc.c`, Annex B access units, pictures converted to NV12 / RGBA); AAC is not there yet (`hle_movie.c` logs
  `[RED]` and goes on with silence). The system's Roboto stands in when a game asks for the shared font and none is there.
- **Scheduling.** Horizon runs one thread at a time per core; a phone with eight big cores runs a Switch core's threads
  truly in parallel, which raced Super Mario Odyssey's core-0 threads into heap corruption at boot. On Android each guest
  thread pinned to one core holds that core's token while it runs (`hle_thread.c` `core_serial`, `DM_CORE_SERIAL=0` turns
  it off): it gives it up while it waits (SVC waits, sleeps, yields, GPU waits in `hle_nvn.c`), hands it to a
  higher-priority thread at its next SVC, and takes the token of its new core when its mask changes, also when another
  thread changed it. A line every 5 s names the thread that waited longest and the one that held the core against it.
- **Graphics.** `src_vk/nvn_vk.c` replays the NVN layer's command lists into Vulkan (its file header has the design:
  ring-buffer copies of what draws read, images in `GENERAL` layout, fragment resources in set 1). Shaders are the
  Metal chain's own SPIR-V, exported by `tools/spv_android.py` (below). BC formats are decoded on upload (BC4-7 by `third_party/bcdec`, MIT / Unlicense), and every
  submission waits on GPU for the one before through a timeline semaphore. Compute dispatches run, and buffers they write
  are tracked until the submission ends (`gw_*`), so draws that read them wait for it. Cube, 3D and array textures used
  as attachments get 2D views (a cube view as an attachment loses the Mali device). Images come from 64 MB blocks with a
  free list; pipelines go through a pipeline cache saved beside the game files. Not there yet: indirect draws, buffer
  textures, geometry / tessellation stages. Diagnostics (`env.txt`): `DM_VK_PASSLOG=<frame>[+]` logs a frame's passes,
  draws, copies and dispatches, `DM_VK_RTDUMP=<frame>` writes its render targets, `DM_VK_SKIP=<mask>` drops kinds of work
  (1 buffer→texture, 2 texture→texture, 4 texture→buffer, 8 clears, 16 uploads, 32 draws / dispatches).
  `BACKEND=null` builds the null backend (`null/nvn_null.c`) instead.

## Shaders

```bash
DM_GAME=<id> DM_GAMES_DIR=<NSP folder>/<id>_build/profile .venv/bin/python dm/android/tools/spv_android.py \
    <NSP folder>/<id>_build/shader/pkg <NSP folder>/<id>_build/shader/cache <NSP folder>/<id>_build/shader/vk
```

It runs the Metal shader build once more into a scratch cache with the translator wrapped, keeping each shader's
SPIR-V (`<key>.spv`, unused capabilities stripped: Mali refuses a module that declares Float64 or fragment interlock)
and its bindings (`<key>.vk.txt`). The chain version does not change. The host finds them through `DM_VK_DIR`.

## Build

```bash
DM_GAMES_DIR=<NSP folder>/<id>_build/profile make -C dm/android GAME=<id> dmhost
```

`NDK=` overrides the NDK (default: Homebrew's `android-ndk` cask). `dmhost` is the host as a command-line program
(`cli/front_cli.c`, no window); the default target builds `libdmhost.so`, the library for the Android app, and
`libdmboot.so`, the app's NativeActivity library (`boot/boot.c`), which loads `libdmhost.so` at a fixed address for
hibernation (`DM_HIBERNATE`, [docs/development.md](../../docs/development.md#hibernation-save-state-to-disk)) and hands the activity to it.

## Run over adb

```bash
adb push gen/<id>/dmhost <patched modules folder> <RomFS> /data/local/tmp/nx/...
adb shell 'cd /data/local/tmp/nx && DM_ROMFS=$PWD/romfs DM_SAVE=$PWD/save DM_TEMP=$PWD/temp DM_FONT_DIR=$PWD/font ./dmhost $PWD/dm main subsdk0 sdk'
```

Add `DM_VK_DIR=$PWD/vk` (the shader folder) and, to see frames, `DM_VK_SHOTS=600,1200 DM_VK_SHOT_DIR=$PWD/shots`.
The log goes to stderr, as on the Mac. `tests/t_tls_slot.c` checks a device for what the port relies on
(`TLS_SLOT_APP` free and kept, executable anonymous memory).

## The app

`app/front_android.c` is the NativeActivity (process `:game`): window → Vulkan swapchain (Android rotates it on phones whose
screen is portrait by nature), controllers by position (the console's own and any other, e.g. an Xbox pad), on-screen
controls drawn over the picture at the first touch (hidden again when a controller is used), − and + held two seconds →
back to the menu. Without dynamic rendering (Vulkan 1.1 / 1.2 GPUs without `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`) the backend uses
render passes made per pass; `DM_VK_NO_DYNREND=1` forces that path for testing. `app/java/com/nxnative/MenuActivity.java`
is the Spanish start-up menu (mode, frame rate, screen fit, language, frame-rate counter, the build's cheats, "no volver a
mostrar"); it writes `<files>/settings.env`, seeds `<files>/save` from `assets/save` on first start and copies `assets/cheats.txt`.

```bash
make -C dm/android GAME=<id>
python3 dm/android/tools/make_apk.py <id> <NSP folder>/<id>_build <out>.apk --label <name> [--save <save folder>] [--cheats <file>]
adb install -r <out>.apk
python3 dm/android/tools/make_apk.py --deploy <id> <NSP folder>/<id>_build   # game files into /sdcard/Android/data/<package>/files
```

`--bundle` puts the game files inside the APK instead (deflated: Hollow Knight's 3.6 GB make a 1.06 GB APK; Android takes
APKs below 4 GB): one file to install without a computer, which the menu unpacks on its first start. Repeated pieces of
archives are stored once. Past 3.8 GB, whole files go to `<APK name>-datos.zip` (no ZIP64, which Android does not read);
the menu asks for it once through the system file picker and checks it belongs to this APK. `--test` makes a
`<package>.prueba` copy that installs beside the real app.

The log is `/sdcard/Android/data/<package>/files/log.txt`; an `env.txt` beside it (KEY=VALUE lines) sets diagnostic switches.

## Next

The missing backend features above; GPU time (images stay in `GENERAL` layout, which keeps Mali from compressing them);
a user-facing script in `scripts/` that goes from NSP to installed app; AAC through MediaCodec.
